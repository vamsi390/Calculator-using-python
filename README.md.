🧮 Simple Python Calculator

This is a basic command-line calculator built using Python. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations:

*   Addition
*   Subtraction
*   Multiplication
*   Division

Features:

*   Interactive user input
*   Continuous calculations using a loop
*   Handles invalid numeric inputs
*   Prevents division by zero
*   Displays results formatted to 2 decimal places

Technologies Used:

*   Python 3
*   Basic Functions
*   While Loop
*   Conditional Statements
*   Exception Handling (try-except)

File Structure:

*   calculator.py
*   README.md

How to Run:

1.  Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2.  Save the file as calculator.py.
3.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
4.  Run the program: `python calculator.py`

How It Works:

1.  The program displays a menu:
    1.  Add
    2.  Subtract
    3.  Multiply
    4.  Divide
2.  User selects an operation.
3.  User enters two numbers.
4.  The selected function performs the calculation.
5.  The result is displayed.
6.  User can continue or exit.

Functions Used:

*   `➕ add(x, y)`: Returns the sum of two numbers.
*   `➖ subtract(x, y)`: Returns the difference of two numbers.
*   `✖️ multiply(x, y)`: Returns the product of two numbers.
*   `➗ divide(x, y)`: Returns the division of two numbers.

Error Handling:

*   If the user enters non-numeric input → Shows an error message.
*   If division by zero is attempted → Displays a warning.
*   If an invalid menu option is selected → Shows "Invalid Input".

Sample Output:


Select operation.
1.Add
2.Subtract
3.Multiply
4.Divide

Enter choice(1/2/3/4): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.00
Let's do next calculation? (yes/no): no
Thanks for using the calculator!
